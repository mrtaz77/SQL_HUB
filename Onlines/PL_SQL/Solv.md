## A1
1. 
    - Write a PL/SQL function that takes two course IDs as arguments and returns TRUE if the first course is a prerequisite of strictly more courses than the second one and FALSE otherwise.


    
    - For all courses offered by departments in the Lambeau building, find whether they have more prerequisites than any course offered by the departments in the Bronfman building and print the information using a PL/SQL anonymous block. Order your output by the course titles as shown below. __You cannot use the INTO or WHILE keywords__.

2. Write a PL/SQL procedure that takes the Student ID and input and calculates
the CGPA per every semester (e.g., Fall 2003). If the CGPA chronologically
increases (let staying the same be considered an increase) in every semester,
print CGPA is always increasing. If the CGPA chronologically decreases in
every semester, print CGPA is always decreasing. Otherwise print CGPA is
following a zig-zag pattern. You can assume the input student ID will be
correct.

## A2_B2    
1. 
    * Write a PL/SQL function that takes student ID as input and returns TRUE
if that student has attended courses of more than ten departments and
FALSE otherwise.
    * Write a PL/SQL anonymous block that loops over, in descending order of
the student ID, all students who have completed exactly 125 credits. For
each student, using the function you have just written, print whether they
have enrolled in more than ten departments or not. __You cannot declare
any variable in the anonymous block__.
