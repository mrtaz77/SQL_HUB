## A1
1. For each instructor, print their ID, name, department name, and the number of
other instructors who have at least one building in common where they teach,
along with the number of such building(s), and sort by the number of instructors.
You cannot use JOIN in the main query.
2. Find the advisors who advise the highest number of students along with the total
credits they oer. You must write at least one subquery to do this.
3. Retrieve the students who have taken more non-departmental courses than
departmental ones. You cannot use JOIN in the main query.
4. For each department, find out the average number of credit hours spent by its
students for its departmental courses. The average should be calculated by
dividing the total number of credits (departmental courses only) taken by the
students of that department divided by the number of students who have taken
departmental courses. You cannot use JOIN in the main query.
5. Retrieve the students who have taken at least two courses where one is covered by their 
advisors and another is oered by some other teacher of their own department. You cannot use JOIN 
or GROUP_BY in the main query.

## A2_B2
1. Find the courses that have the highest enrollment count in each semester. Order the
output according to year and semester.

```sql
SELECT 
		TK1.SEMESTER,
		TK1.YEAR,
		(SELECT TITLE FROM COURSE WHERE COURSE.COURSE_ID=TK1.COURSE_ID) COURSE_TITLE,
		COUNT(*) ENROLLMENT_COUNT 
	FROM
		TAKES TK1
	GROUP BY
		TK1.SEMESTER,
		TK1.YEAR,
		TK1.COURSE_ID
	HAVING
		COUNT(*) >= ALL(
				SELECT
					COUNT(*) NUM 
					FROM
						TAKES TK2
					WHERE
					TK2.YEAR=TK1.YEAR AND
					TK2.SEMESTER=TK1.SEMESTER
					GROUP BY
					TK2.SEMESTER,
					TK2.YEAR,
					TK2.COURSE_ID
			)
		ORDER BY
		TK1.YEAR,
		TK1.SEMESTER;
```


2. Find the distinct courses taught by instructors with at least 100 students receiving a
grade of *A+*. You cannot use join in the main query. You must use SUB-QUERY in
the where clause. You can use join in the sub-queries.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
	( COURSE_ID || ' ' || ( SELECT TITLE FROM COURSE WHERE TEACHES.COURSE_ID = COURSE.COURSE_ID ) ) COURSE_TITLE 
FROM
	TEACHES 
WHERE
	( SELECT COUNT( * ) FROM TAKES WHERE COURSE_ID = TEACHES.COURSE_ID AND ( GRADE ) = 'A+' ) >= 50 
ORDER BY
	COURSE_TITLE;
```
3. Find the distinct course IDs and titles that appear in either the "Comp. Sci."
department or have a prerequisite in the "Math" department. You must use set
operations. You cannot use any join operations. Order the output according to the
department name.

```sql
SELECT 
	*
FROM 
(SELECT
	COURSE_ID,
	TITLE,
	DEPT_NAME 
FROM
	COURSE 
WHERE
	DEPT_NAME = 'Comp. Sci.'
UNION
SELECT
	C1.COURSE_ID,
	C1.TITLE,
	C1.DEPT_NAME 
FROM
	COURSE C1
WHERE EXISTS
	(
			SELECT 
				PREREQ_ID
			FROM
				PREREQ
			WHERE 
				COURSE_ID = C1.COURSE_ID
			AND 
				PREREQ_ID IN (
					SELECT 
						COURSE_ID
					FROM 
						COURSE
					WHERE 
						DEPT_NAME = 'Math'
				)
	))
ORDER BY
	DEPT_NAME,COURSE_ID ;
```

4. Find the courses that have conflicting time slots (overlapping schedules).

```sql
SELECT 
	S1.COURSE_ID "COURSE_ID",
	(SELECT TITLE FROM COURSE WHERE COURSE_ID = S1.COURSE_ID) COURSE_TITLE,
	S2.COURSE_ID "CONFLICTING_COURSE_ID",
	(SELECT TITLE FROM COURSE WHERE COURSE_ID = S2.COURSE_ID) CONFLICTING_COURSE
FROM
	SECTION S1 ,
	SECTION S2 , 
(SELECT 
	T1.TIME_SLOT_ID "T1_ID", 
	T1.END_HR "T1_END_HR",
	T1.END_MIN "T1_END_MIN" ,
	T2.TIME_SLOT_ID "T2_ID",
	T2.START_HR "T2_START_HR" ,
	T2.START_MIN "T2_START_MIN"
FROM 
	TIME_SLOT T1 ,
	TIME_SLOT T2 
WHERE 
	T1.DAY = T2.DAY 
AND 
	T1.TIME_SLOT_ID <> T2.TIME_SLOT_ID
AND 
	T1.START_HR*60 + T1.START_MIN  <= T2.START_HR*60 + T2.START_MIN
AND 
	T1.END_HR*60 + T1.END_MIN > T2.START_HR*60 + T2.START_MIN) T
	WHERE S1.COURSE_ID <> S2.COURSE_ID 
	AND S1.TIME_SLOT_ID = T.T2_ID
	AND S2.TIME_SLOT_ID = T.T1_ID
	AND S1.SEC_ID || S1.SEMESTER || S1.YEAR = S2.SEC_ID || S2.SEMESTER || S2.YEAR
ORDER BY 
	S1.COURSE_ID
```

5. Find the instructors who have taught courses with enrollment counts higher than the
average enrollment count of all courses in each semester. Your column names are
expected to match the provided outputâ€™s column names.

```sql
SELECT 
    (
        SELECT 
        NAME
        FROM 
        INSTRUCTOR
        WHERE 
        ID = (
            SELECT
            TC.ID
            FROM
            TEACHES TC
            WHERE
            TC.COURSE_ID = TK1.COURSE_ID AND
            TC.SEMESTER = TK1.SEMESTER AND
            TC.YEAR = TK1.YEAR 
        )
    ) INSTRUCTOR_NAME,
    COUNT(*) ENROLLMENT_COUNT,
    TK1.SEMESTER,
    TK1.YEAR,
    (SELECT TITLE FROM COURSE WHERE COURSE.COURSE_ID=TK1.COURSE_ID) COURSE_TITLE
FROM
    TAKES TK1
GROUP BY
    TK1.SEMESTER,
    TK1.YEAR,
    TK1.COURSE_ID
HAVING
    COUNT(*) > (
    SELECT AVG(NUM)
    FROM
        (
            SELECT
                COUNT(*) NUM 
            FROM
                TAKES TK2
            WHERE
                TK2.YEAR=TK1.YEAR AND
                TK2.SEMESTER=TK1.SEMESTER
            GROUP BY
                TK2.SEMESTER,
                TK2.YEAR,
                TK2.COURSE_ID
            )
        )
    ORDER BY
    TK1.YEAR,
    TK1.SEMESTER;
```


## B1

the "Comp. Sci." or "Math" departments, along with the list of courses 
that have not been taken by any student in the "Elec. Eng." 
department. Order the output according to course title. You cannot 
use any join operations. 

```sql
SELECT
    TITLE COURSE_TITLE 
FROM
    COURSE 
WHERE
    COURSE_ID IN ( SELECT COURSE_ID FROM TAKES WHERE ID IN ( SELECT ID FROM STUDENT WHERE DEPT_NAME IN ( 'Comp. Sci.', 'Math' ) ) ) UNION

```

2. Find the students who are advised by an instructor who teaches at least 
one course that the student has taken. You cannot use any GROUP 
functions. Order the output according to student name. 

```sql

WHERE
	ID IN ( SELECT S_ID FROM ADVISOR ) 
	AND EXISTS (
	SELECT
		COURSE_ID 
	FROM

```

3. Find the names, departments and total credits of students who have 
completed all the prerequisites for 'Image Processing' course of 
'Finance' department. Order the output according to student name.You
